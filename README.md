# Tetris-Based-Console-Game

A simple yet engaging console-based Tetris game written in Python, featuring two distinct modes: Classic Mode for traditional gameplay and Twist Mode for a unique, unpredictable experience. The game tracks scores and high scores for added competitiveness.

## Features
### Game Modes
1. Classic Mode
   * Traditional Tetris gameplay where players move, rotate, and drop Tetrominoes to clear rows and score points.
2. Frenzy Mode
